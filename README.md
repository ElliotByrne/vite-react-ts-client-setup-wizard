# TurnPoint Client Table project

This project was created as a demonstration of my React skills for a job opportunity at TurnPoint.

## Prerequisite

Firstly, make sure you've got the Express JS API project running. This will make a new SQL database. This project relies on the data being available in this database on your `localhost:3000`.

`git clone https://github.com/ElliotByrne/vite-react-ts-client-setup-wizard.git`

Make sure you've followed the setup instructions on the above repo before continuing with this project setup.

## Get started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

The application should now be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.

Click on the `(?)` button at the top right of the table to learn how to use the application.

## Things to note

I was only able to commit three days to this project due to other life commitments, but I feel like I've met all of the requirements. I have added some extra features that I hope you appriciate, enjoy playing around with it!

See below some niggles that I am already aware of. I am frustrated to submit the project with these small issues outstanding, and in a real world project this wouldn't be the case. If I had an extra few hours on it I am certain these would be fixed.

1. For the best expirience, view this project on a larger monitor. I wasn't able to finesse the responsiveness of the web app which means the 'wizard' may overlap the modal. The modal may also overflow the app container on smaller screens.

2. The TypeScript typings could be a bit tighter.

3. I wish I had time to set up some unit tests using jest.

4. Would have been nice to finesse the accessibility of the website.

5. I was planning to include sorting functionality to each column but didn't manage to in time.

6. For the ExpressJS repo, I should have done this using TypeScript. Although I hope the front-end code shows that I am proficient in using TS. Also, I was hoping to include server side validation but I didn't have the time.
